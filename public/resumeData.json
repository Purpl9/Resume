    "bio": "I am a system administrator familiar with virtualization with VMWare, backup systems with Veeam and with WatchGuard firewalls, plus I have been working for a year in the healthcare sector, which I could describe as a very complex environment where I learned to control my emotions under stressful situations and being a very decisive person.I could describe myself as a very responsible person who at first tends to be very reserved but very sociable and eager to meet and be known. Learning and improving over time is one of my main objectives, I really want to continue growing both personally and professionally, from this I could highlight that right now I am very interested in CyberSecurity and it is a sector where I would like to finish working and show my potential once I get the necessary training.",
